# movie_recommendation
A movie recommender system project based on content based filtering
A content-based movie recommender system suggests movies to users based on the attributes and features of movies they have liked before. It analyzes factors like genre, actors, directors, and plot keywords to recommend similar movies, providing personalized suggestions without needing extensive user data.
I have used google colab to develop this project
